#AUTOMATED CUSTOMER COMPLAINT ANALYSIS USING NLP
This project presents a comprehensive system for automating the processing and analysis of customer complaints using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The system preprocesses textual data, categorizes complaints into relevant departments, detects sarcasm, summarizes content, and extracts keyword to provide actionable insights for organizations. Additionally, anti-bot techniques are implemented along with session restrictions to prevent interactions with chatbots or automated scripts, ensuring the integrity and functionality of the system. 

Keywordsâ€” NLP, machine learning, customer complaints, sarcasm detection, data summarization, keyword extraction, Email-Automation, Anti-bot techniques.
